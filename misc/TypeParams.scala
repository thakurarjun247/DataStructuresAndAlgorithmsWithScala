*Type parameterization allows you to write generic classes and traits. For example, sets are generic and
take a type parameter: they are defined as Set[T]. As a result, any particular set instance might be
a Set[String], a Set[Int], etc., but it must be a set of something. Unlike Java, which allows raw
types, Scala requires that you specify type parameters. Variance defines inheritance relationships of
parameterized types, such as whether a Set[String], for example, is a subtype of Set[AnyRef].
